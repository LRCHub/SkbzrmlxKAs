Hey sister, hey sister
Things move all alone
You know that I
Can't stand what you do
And it won't be too long
Hey soldier, hey soldier
Things die on their own
You know that I
Can't stand what you do
And it won't be too long
And I'm sure that it won't be too long
And I'm tired of pretending I'm wrong
