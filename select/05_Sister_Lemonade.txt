I think I'd like to meet your sister
She looked at us through a picture
Staring through the fragile glass
You sitting with her

I heard you used to be a diver
And you never broke the water
Passing through the water's skin
You ought to mention to another

All the people that are gonna meet
Don't wanna give them anything
All the people that are gonna meet

I heard that you spent your summers
Sometimes only with each other
Floating in the pool all night
Light from below you

I think I'm someone who can listen
And never repeat any secrets
If you see them in the shape of my eyes
Let me know that you hear it

All the people that are gonna meet
Don't wanna give them anything
All the people that are gonna meet

It's her reflection on the water (sister)
